      <h3>Hello friend!</h3> 
        need some help?
      <p> We are here to assist you to getting started in
          your new internship in Amsterdam. Our beloved city
          has loads of culture to dive in, but before we get started
          we need to check if you'll be needing any documents or
          maybe some direction how to get started. On the main page
          are clickable subjects that'll navigate you to your preference.
